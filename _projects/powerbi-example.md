# PowerBI Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive dashboards using Microsoft PowerBI. The dashboard analyzes sales data across multiple dimensions including time, geography, and product categories.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Users can filter data by date range, region, and product
- **KPI Cards:** Display key metrics like total revenue, profit margin, and units sold
- **Trend Analysis:** Line charts showing sales trends over time
- **Geographic Analysis:** Map visualization showing sales by region
- **Product Performance:** Bar charts comparing product categories

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preparation
- DAX formulas for calculated measures
- Interactive dashboard design
- Data visualization best practices
- Business intelligence reporting

## PowerBI Dashboard

Below is the interactive PowerBI report. You can interact with the filters and visualizations.

## Insights & Findings

### Key Insights

1. **Revenue Growth:** Overall revenue increased by 15% quarter-over-quarter
2. **Top Region:** The North region generated 35% of total sales
3. **Best Seller:** Product Category A accounted for 40% of units sold
4. **Seasonal Trends:** Sales peak in Q4, likely due to holiday shopping

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend:
